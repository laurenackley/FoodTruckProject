<h1>Food Truck Project</h1>

<h2> Description: </h2>
This program does the following: Asks the user to input a food truck, which my favorite idea for a 24/7 food truck would be twentyPHOseven.. but the program asks you to enter a name, food type, and rating. Then the program will assign it an identifier to the object "FoodTruck". You can enter up to 5 food trucks, but can end before 5. 
Next after entering 5 or typing "quit" you have the options to list all the existing food trucks with their data, see the average rating of all food trucks entered, list the highest rated food truck with all of its details, or quit. 
The program will continue until quit is entered.

<h2>Things I learned:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Static vs nonStatic </li>
<li>Constructors </li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Using classes from another file</li>
<li>How to import from another file as well</li>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
One of the most important things that I learned from this lab is the **importance** of TA help. I was very confused on how to pull the information from the object in the array and use the getters and setters. Luckily I had a LOT of help to break it down for me.  

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
Java, GitHub, FoodTruckProject, Oracle, and StackOverflow
